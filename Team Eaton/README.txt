J. Johnson Notes:

Black Hair:
- I like all the ideas around Black Hair, but unfortunately there is not much publicly available data...BUT you should think about/research what data you would need to collect in order to determine what hair products black women should use.

- I especially like the question about how AI systems detect black women...it's sort of a reverse engineering/ML approach. You could research existing practices and highlight any biases or questionable approaches.
